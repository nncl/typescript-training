# Typescript Training

Typescript Training tho.

## Getting Started

It's required to have installed at least Node.JS version 6.

Install typescript via npm:

```
npm i -g typescript
```

To run a command transforming your `ts` file into `js` file, execute:

```
tsc <filename>.ts
```

It's gonna create a `<filename>.js` file.

You can also watch this file running:

```
tsc -w <filename>.ts
```

It's gonna print something like:

```
00:38:11 - Starting compilation in watch mode...
00:38:14 - Compilation complete. Watching for file changes.
```

Finally, you can execute your `js` file running:

```
node <filename>.js
```
